				<p class="intro">
				The Centre for Process Innovation is a UK-based technology innovation centre and part of the High Value Manufacturing Catapult. We use applied knowledge in science and engineering combined with state of the art facilities to enable our clients to develop, prove, prototype and scale up the next generation of products and processes.

				Our open innovation model enables clients to develop products and prove processes with minimal risk. We provide assets and expertise so our customers can demonstrate the process and prove it is feasible before investing substantial amounts of money in capital equipment and training. New products and processes can be proven; on paper, in the lab and in the plant before being manufactured at an industrial scale.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				By utilising our proven assets and expertise companies can take their products and processes to market faster. There is no down time in production as all of the process development is completed offsite and our technology transfer teams can help to transfer the product or process into full scale production.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We are home to the UK’s National Centres for Printable Electronics, Industrial Biotechnology and Anaerobic Digestion. We work in seven core technology areas. These are:
