				<p>The UK is a key driver in the manufacturing industry, which accounts for over £6.7tr of the global economy. The UK is ranked in the world’s top 10 manufacturing nations and the sector employs over 2.5 million people, accounting for over 50 per cent of the UK export market and over 75 per cent of all research and development programmes.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="four columns">
				<p>Yet despite strengths in industries such as aerospace and pharmaceuticals, the UK continues to face
the challenge of competing with countries where production and labour costs are significantly lower and the markets although, emerging, are often larger.</p>
			</div>	
				
			
			<div class="four columns">
				<p>Critical to the success of UK manufacturing industry and its processes are the many thousands of Small and Medium Sized Businesses (SMEs) who form part of the critical value chain and who work with the larger manufacturers to design and manufacture today’s products.

				What are the challenges facing the process sector today?

			<div class="eight columns">
				<p>The growing economic power of Asia; the Government focus upon innovation and research and development; the birth of relatively new industries such as renewable energy and photonics and an increased demand from end users with more disposable income are all shaping the direction of the industry. However, the overarching challenge is clear – in order to compete globally on a level manufacturing plane, the UK must create more adaptable and cost efficient processes to advance
its manufacturing systems and create new business models to support them.</p>

<p>Only by evaluating and in some cases deconstructing the manufacturing process can it truly become more responsive to changing market demands. There has never been a greater need for processes to be bespoke and entirely flexible to reduce costs and make the entire process sector leaner and more efficient. The evolution of process engineering is now focused upon developing techniques concurrently and creating systems that allow for reconfigurable manufacturing.</p>

<p>While the potential for techniques such as additive manufacture may be well documented and publicised, the use of such cost saving, efficient processes are not yet mainstream. However, digital layering processes dispense with exorbitant tooling costs and minimise waste. These processes only uses the material needed to make a part whereas traditional subtractive process can waste up to 95 per cent of the raw material used to create a component. Consequently additive processes require far less raw material. Furthermore, the digital layering process removes traditional product design constraints empowering designers to develop lightweight, complicated geometric products previously unimaginable.</p>

				<p>If all industries, especially those in the high value manufacturing sector, could understand the need and inherent benefits of developing new processes then the vital link between designer and developer could also be fully restored bridging a key part of the gap in the value chain and strengthening the UK’s position in the manufacturing field.</p>
						

								
				<h4 class="pinktext">Barriers to enhanced flexibility and high value manufacturing:</h4>
<ul>						
<li><strong class="pinktext">Costs</strong> – manufacturing costs remain high and significant investment in the economy is needed</li>
<li><strong class="pinktext">Materials shortage</strong> – resources are not finite and sustainable alternatives are needed</li>
<li><strong class="pinktext">Skills shortage</strong> – a greater feed of new talent in the fields of science, maths, engineering and technology</li>
<li><strong class="pinktext">Demonstration</strong> – the inability to showcase new products and processes in a commercial setting results in products failing at the prototype stage</li>
<li><strong class="pinktext">Weakened supply chains</strong> - SMEs continue to compete with the high volume of manufactured imports. New business models are required to harness innovation</li>		
</ul>						
						
				
				<h4 class="bluetext">CPI breaks these barriers down by:</h4>
				
<ul>				
<li><strong class="bluetext">Channeling the expertise</strong> of CPI scientists and engineers to develop new, agile manufacturing processes</li>
<li><strong class="bluetext">Demonstrating proven capability</strong> in adaptive, flexible, near net shaping and additive manufacturing</li>

				<p>Aquapharm is a leading marine biotechnology company pioneering the discovery and development of novel biochemistry isolated from the under explored biological diversity of marine microbes.</p>
				
				<p>Aquapharm’s core focus is to develop novel antibiotics to treat Gram negative and Gram positive infections e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, penicillin resistant Streptococci pneumoniae (PRSP), MRSA, & VRE and to isolate novel marine natural products for pharmaceutical applications. In addition, Aquapharm has discovery activities in consumer / personal healthcare, nutrition and biocatalysis.</p>
				
				<p>Through the application of proprietary fermentation ‘stress / screening’ technology to its microbial library, Aquapharm induces the production of biologically active compounds from micro-organisms that are not produced under traditional fermentation conditions. The Company has a number of antibiotic drug candidates with the lead anti-Gram positive candidate</p>
				
				<p>currently in pre-clinical development. Aquapharm has also enjoyed considerable success in the discovery of a number of leads effective against Gram negative bacteria.</p>
				
				<p>Andrew Mearns-Spragg, CEO of Aquaphar says:</p>
				
<p class="bluetext">“Establishing the National Industrial Biotechnology Facility is of huge importance and such a facility within the UK is central to the development of marine bioprocessing. The facilities at CPI are excellent, without the National Industrial Biotechnology Facility it would have been much more difficult for us to move our work forward. We would have had to have looked abroad for help.</p>

<p class="bluetext">Capitalising on both the facilities and expertise at CPI has enabled Aquapharm to move significantly forward in achieving its core aims and moving closer to commercial production of its lead candidates. Marine bioprocessing is really in its infancy, to have this facility at CPI is very important.”</p>

				<p>Sanofi Aventis aims to become a diversified global healthcare leader, and to this end utilised the facilities at CPI to demonstrate the potential of Corning Advanced-Flow reactors for multiphase hydrogenations in high volume manufacturing.</p>
				
				<p>In the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries, most multiphase hydrogenation reactions are conducted in large batch or semi-batch reactors, in which the catalyst is suspended in liquid and continuously stirred. Batch reactors are often susceptible to lack of temperature control, which can result in hot spots on the catalyst’s surface. These hotspots lead to the formation of several by-products or intermediaries, which can result in decomposition. In recent years there has been increasing interest in the testing of micro reactors at laboratory scale for catalytic hydrogenations as, due to their small transverse dimensions, they have exceptionally high surface to volume ratios and therefore exhibit enhanced heat and mass transfer rates. Typically, the micro reactors are producing from 0.1 to 10 grams per hour, so are very well suited for screening or small scale production. A natural progression was to scale up</p>
				
				<p>this process for industrial production to several hundred tons per year, which requires production rates of at least one hundred times higher.</p>

<p>CPI, Sanofi-Aventis and Corning believed the implementation of slurry hydrogenation in continuous flow reactors would effectively solve this issue. The method was tested at CPI’s state-of-the-art flow reaction facility using Corning’s Advanced-Flow glass reactor, an assembly of glass fluidic modules connected together through appropriate piping. CPI successfully operated the reactor and the conversion, selectivity, impurity profile and the catalyst content were studied by the highly skilled team. After over 300 hours of operation, results concluded that over 98 percent conversion could be achieved with the continuous flow reactor for starting material concentrations from 30 wt percent to 45 wt percent. The catalyst content proved to have very little impact in a wide range of concentrations, opening the door to potential savings versus the batch reactor processing. These results successfully prove the high potential of Corning Advanced-Flow reactors for slurry-based hydrogenation at an industrially important scale.</p>
