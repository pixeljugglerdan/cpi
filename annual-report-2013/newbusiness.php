				<p>Value capture is at the core of the manufacturing industry. Or at least it should be. An all encompassing production model is essential if the UK is to up the ante and compete more successfully on the international stage. Not only will enhanced value chains deliver financial rewards, but a holistic chain will also significantly improve nationwide research and development programmes, enabling commercialisation and providing vital infrastructure for other businesses whilst protecting intellectual property. Moreover an effective value chain will support the retention of our rich engineering and scientific skill base and assist in the evolution and advancement of our process industry.</p>

			<div class="four columns">
				<p>Today, the world we inhabit is entirely interconnected. The challenge lies in understanding how to combine the assets and capabilities we have in the UK to create and capture value more effectively. Currently, the UK economy does not capture as much value as it should from innovative product development and manufacture. The need to maximise value development throughout the product lifecycle, as well as closer relationships between academics and industry is increasingly prevalent as other global forces benefit from the UK’s fragmented value chains. We must question why we are outsourcing production from within the UK and as a result reducing our</p>

				What are the challenges facing our current value chains?
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

	
		<div class="row">
			<div class="eight columns">
				<p>The threat posed by emerging economies such as the BRIC and N11 territories are real and have been for some time now. This threat coupled with the advances made by the German, Japanese and US markets particularly in terms of high value manufacturing is gradually diminishing the impact the UK has in industry. The challenge to develop new supply chain and production networks in the UK has therefore never been more critical, as the emergence and establishment of global value chains continues to minimise value capture and has a negative impact upon the UK economy. Moreover our SMEs face huge barriers in accessing global value chains and as such are unable to compete with their global counterparts. However, the challenge is not about simplifying access to global production networks. It is much more complicated, as in fact the UK must continue to develop its own integrated value networks capable of sustaining the economy and realising the superior value systems of old.</p>

<p>While it may seem too simple, the best solution for effectively managing fragmented value chains is to develop and build new business models that bridge any gaps and link all stages in the manufacturing process together as one whole. The production of intermediate goods such as components and parts production may be the larger sum of the overall fragmentation the UK is now facing, but the breakdown of our value chain has also included the accompanying knowledge intensive services, such as R&D, inventory management, quality control, and other professional and technical services. If the UK is to truly regain its eminence in the manufacturing industry then new systems centred around cross disciplinary skill sets and new value propositions are vital.</p>
								
				<h4 class="pinktext">Barriers to developing new business models:</h4>
				
				<ul>
				<li><strong class="pinktext">Skills shortage</strong> – an ageing population coupled with an education system not fully aligned with industry needs</li>
<li><strong class="pinktext">Funding gap</strong> – finance including venture capital funding remains difficult to obtain</li>
<li><strong class="pinktext">Policy</strong> and regulations – procurement issues and evolving government policies are impacting upon responsiveness</li>
<li><strong class="pinktext">Risk</strong> – resilience to investing in new models coupled with challenging policy and regulatory obstructions</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4 class="bluetext">CPI breaks these barriers down by:</h4>

				<ul>
<li><strong class="bluetext">Collaboration</strong>  – working with the government through the High Value Manufacturing Catapult to influence and shape economic, taxation and regulatory policies</li>
<li><strong class="bluetext">Business support</strong>  – working with businesses to create strong and sound business cases for long-term investment</li>

				<h2>The Northern Way Printed Electronic Supply Chain Programme</h2>
			</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="four columns">
				<p>The programme is a unique initiative, bringing together the cities and regions of the North of England to
work together to improve the sustainable economic development of the North. The Northern Way works with local authorities, universities, the private sector and other partners to secure a strong coalition in support of this goal.</p>

				<p>The Northern Way’s ‘Building the Supply Chain in Printed Electronics’ programme is targeted at providing the funding and collaboration infrastructure within which participating organisations can explore and ultimately exploit the opportunity within the Printed Electronics market.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="four columns">
				
				<p>The competition was broken down into a series of work packages to stimulate the growth of a supply chain and ultimately develop working demonstrators of what the technology could achieve. The competition involved twenty organisations across eight projects and directly resulted in at least eight patents being filed.</p>
				
				<p>Work packages one and two were focused on the scale up of molecules to one kilo and beyond for repeatable batches of Organic Semiconductors (OSCs), and on the development of ink formulation for printing. The aim was to transfer this gained knowledge to the chemical companies, who, in turn, subsequently developed a range of OSCs, increased links and increased the understanding of the technology’s potential, workings and benefits.</p>

			</div>
		
			<div class="four columns">
								
<p>Packages four and five were focused on the development process, working under the principle that simpler structures give superior performance and reduced costs. Challenges in this area were to gain knowledge of what is required when processing material to develop transistor performance great enough to drive Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) and to continually improve the quality and applications for Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED).</p>

<p>The final work packages centred around the Demonstrators competition, in which eight demonstrator projects were developed and working prototypes produced.</p>
