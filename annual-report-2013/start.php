					The UK process and manufacturing industries face substantial obstacles as they look to advance the evolution of innovative new products, technologies and services. In response, The Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) was established and since its inception in 2004 has worked to provide commercially viable solutions to this growing concern.
					</p>
					
					<p>The global population is inexorably rising, and as such demand and consumption of all manufactured goods and services mirrors this growth. Yet pitched against this growth in consumption is an increasing pressure on the earth’s finite supply of natural resources. These two conflicting drivers will continue to converge until the conventional processes and methods of supply can no longer meet the rising demand. As such in this environment there is an overwhelming need for global manufacturing innovators to develop products which reduce the consumption of natural resources or that make a wider range of resources, derived from the waste of our biological processes, available to our manufacturers.</p>

					<p>In response, The Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) was established and since its inception a decade ago has worked to provide commercially viable solutions to meet this growing global challenge.</p>
					<p>CPI uses applied knowledge in science and engineering combined with state-of-the-art development facilities to enable our clients and partners to develop, prove, prototype and scale up the next generation of products and processes. Working with our experienced team, companies
can significantly de-risk the development process and can bring products to market faster while reducing the environmental impact and costs throughout the manufacturing cycle.</p>

			<p>During the last decade we have worked with over 2,000 companies and organisations including SMEs, Universities and large corporate clients globally. We have successfully completed over 350 public and private projects with a total value in excess of £300M. Moreover we have worked with a host of FTSE 100 companies and FTSE 250 companies to help them develop improved products and processes to grow their business.</p>
			
			<p>By integrating our £55M worth of diverse capital equipment with the expertise of our renowned team of engineers, process developers and scientists, we have participated in over 50 European Projects to the value of €118M. These projects are helping UK manufacturers bring new technologies, products and services to market, creating value for the UK and enhancing commercial competition globally.</p>
			
			<p>More recently, CPI has played a pivotal role in the successful creation and launch of the UK government’s High Value Manufacturing Catapult. This cross supply chain initiative heralds a sustained investment into manufacturing and CPI’s proven ability to assist companies in the development and delivery of the next generation of products and processes is vital to its success. Most importantly, the High Value Manufacturing Catapult brings together individual innovation centres in a collaborative network that creates something even greater than the sum of its parts a single network covering high- value sectors from pharmaceuticals to power generation, where knowledge gained in one area can be transferred to others.</p>
			
			<p>Being part of the High Value Manufacturing Catapult, our challenge is to introduce our low cost, low carbon manufacturing approach to build and enhance supply chains across the process and manufacturing industries to bolster economic stability.</p>
			
			<p>All the while, CPI continues to make great progress toward its vision of becoming a world-class centre of innovation for the process industry, stimulating a more innovative, sustainable and competitive sector by reducing the risks associated with innovation and allowing businesses to benefit from growing international demand.</p>
