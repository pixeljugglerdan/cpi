				The process industry is the unsung hero of the majority of manufacturing supply chains. It supplies the often complex and specialist raw materials that are used to create all our manufactured goods. As such it is closely linked to all manufacturing sectors.

				<p>The sustainability of the earth and its resources is one of the biggest challenges we face. As demand inexorably rises with increasing population and affluence we must address the fact that our resources are not endless. If we continue to consume them wastefully at an ever-increasing rate our natural resources will eventually start to run out leading to scarcity of the products that sustain our lifestyle coupled with rapidly increasing prices. The major challenge that comes from this issue is the need to reduce the pressure on the earth by making better use of resources, creating more efficient and lower cost processes that use less irreplaceable natural assets. At CPI our key priority is to assist our partners address </p>

				<div class="six columns">
				<p>this very issue from a market-led commercial perspective. We help companies to develop lower cost, higher efficiency processes that make better use of the world’s resources. For example by replacing fossil fuel feedstocks with bio or waste derived materials; by redesigning processes to increase their yield by up to 60 per cent by helping them produce materials and products that can replace expensive and scarce alternatives; by recovering and reusing resources with innovative processes and by linking processes together into networks or closed loops that minimise wastes and emissions. All of these innovative process developments present very real</p>

			<p>market opportunities and CPI’s role is to collaborate with public and private organisations to realise those opportunities.</p> 
			<p>The issue is big, it is important and the potential benefits both financially and environmentally are huge. Fortunately, CPI has the expertise and experience to provide effective solutions and there are three core strands at the heart of our offering. Firstly, our proven capability levels the playing field with competing companies and allows the wider industrial market to recognise the UK has the technical capability and an economic environment that enables confident investment. Secondly, we work with local, indigenous UK companies -</p>

			<p>both SMEs and larger established businesses - to improve their products and as a result enable them to reduce their prices. By complementing their existing research and development capabilities we can facilitate their delivery process enabling them to get there faster and more efficiently. Finally, our team can lobby to create a supporting case for long-term investment. Although a subtle quality, this is vital in ensuring the viability and sustainability of the industry.</p>
			
<p>What progress are we making? Over the course of the last decade CPI has grown steadily year on year and the companies we work with are delivering processes</p>

			<p>and products to the market that contribute to the overarching solution. However, we at CPI are acutely aware of how much further we need to go and we look forward to continuing to collaborate with the manufacturing sector to transform our industries to address the needs of the 21st century.</p>
